## Instructions
This project was originally implemented as a Vagrant deployment. If you are looking for the Vagrant-based deployment for this, please go to the [vagrant-halcyon-kubernetes](https://github.com/att-comdev/halcyon-vagrant-kubernetes) repository. Vagrant deployment and use instructions are provided in that repository (including deployments directly to AWS, Openstack, and Virtualbox).

1. Use your own inventory file, with the following groups:
    - kube-masters (single node: for now)
    - kube-workers (as many as you'd like, excluding the master)
    - kube-control (same as your master)
2. Deploy via Ansible


## Add-Ons
This project will also support add-ons; both Kubernetes native add-ons as well as projects such as (https://github.com/kubernetes/helm)[Helm] (for developing Kubernetes Helm (https://github.com/kubernetes/charts)[Charts]). A Current list of add-ons include:

  - Kubernetes Dashboard
  - Helm

You will find these options in the `group_vars/all.yml` file.

# TODO

* Terraform-based Deployment Options will be provided in another repository soon!
